                <p>When I first started learning JavaScript a few years back, I know that I made tons of mistakes.  (And I still do make a lot of mistakes now!  Thank heavens for IDEs that catch most of those mistakes!)  All of this is to say that if you are just starting out with this stuff, you are not alone.  So, I thought that it might be helpful for any beginners out there (and certainly good practice for me on this platform) to create yet another tutorial-type site that can help them see how code works or why it might break.  Please keep in mind that I am no expert in JavaScript.  I hope that this helps!</p>
